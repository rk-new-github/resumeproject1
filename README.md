Project implemented a classroom simulation using custom singly and circular linked lists and 2D arrays to manage
students’ movement across classroom states: in line, seated, and playing musical chairs.

Also uses a system to initialize seating arrangements using 2D boolean arrays and parallel arrays to represent and
manage valid seat locations. Code structures input files to dynamically build and update classroom state, leveraging custom data structures and modular helper methods.
